Variable Schema Proof of Concept
================================

This project is about implementing user-defined schemas using mongodb and either python or NodeJS.

#Setup
You must install mongodb and python 2.7 (should be installed already if you're running OSX), and then you have to perform database setup. Simply run `mongo dbsetup.js` on your local installation (assuming that you've got no permissions restrictions in place) to preconfigure the database.
